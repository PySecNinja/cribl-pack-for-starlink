This error can occur when a Call Agent switch has been replaced and the previous switch is still on-line, or possibly if an IP Phone has been moved from one ShoreWare IP Phone System to another.  To correct this the IP Phone should be deconfigured from the rogue Call Agent or the rogue Call Agent should be taken off-line."}]
