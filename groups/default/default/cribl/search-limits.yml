# Defines how long the queue of queries can get. 
# Whenever we exceed the maxConcurrentSearches limit, we start queueing queries. The
# number of queued queries can be limited via this parameter. If an absolute number
# is provided, it specifies the max. number of jobs waiting in a queue and any further
# jobs get rejected. If it is a % specification, it is relative to maxConcurrentSearches.
# So, if maxConcurrentSearches is 2 and searchQueueLength is 500%, the queue length
# is actually limited to 10 entries, allowing us to specify the queue length relative
# to the system's processing capacity.
