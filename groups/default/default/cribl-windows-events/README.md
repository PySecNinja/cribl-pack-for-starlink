# Windows Pack
----
This pack is targeted for collections of Window events in the Classic or newer XML format. For events in the Classic format, sometimes the Message field contains XML.  These Message fields are also taken into consideration.  The `WindowsClassicEvents` and `WindowsXMLEvents` pipelines inside the pack gives you the ability to shape events into JSON or Key=Value format and dramatically reduce event sizes.

# Important Information
---
```
This pack may be incompatible with some Splunk dashboards that depend on specific field extractions.
The Windows-TA will also not work with this pack as all events are in a clean universal format.

Please review various Splunk add-ons and configuration files such as props.conf or transforms.conf and make adjustments as necessary.
The final output is JSON, but you can use Serialize to change to other formats if necessary.
JSON or KV formats can be auto-extracted in Splunk

In Splunk:
Step 1: Disable the Windows-TA
Step 2: If events are transformed to JSON set kv_mode=json
Step 3: Evaluate the fields and dashboards and see if you need to make alias in Splunk or add a Rename function in LogStream.
```

# What to Expect
---
* Classic Event Reduction:  Expect up to 70% reduction in the event size.
* XML Event Reduction:  Expect a range from 25%-50% reduction in the event size.
